 [1/15/25, 2:15 PM] Rohan: Ruby. My Garmin is logging
consistently high intensity minutes, even on rest days. I
suspect it's my POTS/long COVID. My current health
management is ad-hoc. I need a proper medical review. My
supplement list is attached.

Rohans_Supplement_Regime.pdf
3. [1/15/25, 2:38 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Hi [Rohan], thank you
for sharing this. We've received your supplement list. Are you
experiencing any other symptoms like dizziness or shortness
of breath alongside the high intensity minutes? I am flagging
this for Dr. Warren to review immediately as Priority 1.
4. [1/15/25, 2:40 PM] Rohan: Some dizziness on standing. No SOB.
5. [1/15/25, 2:41 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Understood. Thank you
for clarifying. Dr. Warren will review and we will come back
with a plan.
6. [1/16/25, 10:00 AM] Dr. Warren (Elyx Medical): [Rohan], Dr.
Warren here. I've reviewed your initial submission. The
symptoms and data strongly suggest autonomic dysfunction
(Pillar 1). To proceed with a clinical-grade strategy, we must
consolidate your complete medical records from all previous
specialists. This is non-negotiable to ensure safety and avoid
redundant testing.
7. [1/16/25, 10:05 AM] Rohan: Acknowledged. How long will that
take?
8. [1/16/25, 10:10 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): The timeline can vary
depending on the clinics' response speed, but we will manage
the entire process, including phone calls and faxes. We
typically aim to have all records within 2-3 weeks. We will
provide you with daily updates on the status.
9. [1/16/25, 3:00 PM] Rohan: My wife also needs a referral to a
top-tier dermatologist in the Bay Area for a persistent rash.
Can you handle that?
10. [1/16/25, 3:02 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Absolutely. That is part
of our family service. Could you please provide her name and
DOB so I can create a sub-profile for her? We will research the
best specialists at UCSF and Stanford and come back with
recommendations and our rationale for each.
11. [1/16/25, 3:05 PM] Rohan: [Wife's Name], DOB: [XX/XX/XXXX].
12. [1/16/25, 3:06 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Thank you. We are on
it.
13. [1/17/25, 11:00 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Good morning. We
have created the initial shell for your Health Optimization Plan
in our secure portal. For now, it's mostly empty, but it's where
our entire strategy will live. The first step for you is a
comprehensive Lifestyle Consultation with our Head of
Performance, Dr. Advik, to begin populating it.
14. [1/17/25, 11:01 AM] Rohan: When?
15. [1/17/25, 11:05 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): I will check his clinical
schedule and come back to you with options that fit your
stated preference for mornings.
16. [1/17/25, 4:30 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Update on your wife's
dermatology referral: We have identified three leading
dermatologists. Dr. Alice Ma at Stanford is a national expert on
inflammatory skin conditions. Her waitlist is typically 6 months,
but we have a relationship with her office. Would you like us to
pursue an appointment with her?
17. [1/17/25, 4:35 PM] Rohan: Yes, do that.
18. [1/18/25, 3:00 PM] Rohan: I have not heard about scheduling the
Advik consult.
19. [1/18/25, 3:05 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): My apologies. I am
coordinating with his schedule now. I will have options for you
by EOD
. [1/18/25, 5:30 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): [Rohan], Dr. Advik has
an opening on Feb 1st at 3 PM or Feb 2nd at 11 AM. Do either of
those work?
21. [1/19/25, 9:02 AM] Rohan: Neither work. Check the week of Feb
5th. Mornings only.
22. [1/19/25, 9:15 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Understood. I see a
potential slot on Feb 5th at 10 AM. I've placed a soft hold on it.
Please let me know if I should confirm.
23. [1/20/25, 11:00 AM] Rohan: Yes, confirm the Feb 5th slot.
24. [1/20/25, 11:02 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Confirmed. The
calendar invitation has been sent with a preliminary agenda.
25. [1/21/25, 10:30 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Good morning. A
thought from our team: while we gather records,
understanding your current state is useful. Would you be open
to completing a 3-day food log? No need to change anything,
just record what you eat. This gives our nutritionist, Carla, a
baseline for Pillar 3.
26. [1/21/25, 10:35 AM] Rohan: Fine. Send me the template.
27. [1/21/25, 10:36 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): It's a simple notes
app format; just text or photos. Whatever is easiest for you. I've
shared a secure note link.
28. [1/22/25, 2:00 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): To get a head start on
the record retrieval for Pillar 1, could you please add your
assistant, Suzane, to this chat? We can then liaise with her
directly for the administrative details.
29. [1/22/25, 2:01 PM] Rohan: System Message: Rohan has added
Suzane to the group.
30. [1/22/25, 2:03 PM] Suzane: Hi all.
31. [1/22/25, 2:04 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Welcome, Suzane.
Could you please provide the clinic names and locations for
[Rohan]'s cardiologists in Singapore and New York? We will
prepare the necessary medical release forms and send them
to you for his signature.
32. [1/23/25, 10:15 AM] Suzane: The details have been uploaded to
our shared drive.
33. [1/23/25, 10:20 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Thank you, Suzane.
We are preparing the forms now. They will be with you this
afternoon.
34. [1/24/25, 11:30 AM] Rohan: I have a last minute flight to Chicago
tomorrow. Any recommended healthy restaurants near The
Loop for a business dinner?
35. [1/24/25, 11:45 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Of course. I'll research
options that can accommodate a clean, low-inflammatory
meal. One moment.
36. [1/24/25, 12:30 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Based on your
preferences, I recommend "True Food Kitchen". It focuses on
an anti-inflammatory menu. I've attached their menu. Would
you like me to make a reservation for you?
37. [1/24/25, 12:31 PM] Rohan: Yes. 7:30 PM for 4 people.
38. [1/24/25, 12:32 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Done. Reservation is
confirmed. It's in your calendar.
39. [1/25/25, 1:00 PM] Rohan: attached: Food_Log_Day1.png
40. [1/25/25, 1:05 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Received, thank you.
Forwarding to Carla.
41. [1/26/25, 3:00 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Hi Suzane, just a
gentle follow-up on the signed release forms. We need them
to formally initiate the requests.
42. [1/26/25, 3:30 PM] Suzane: He is traveling. I will get them signed
as soon as he lands this evening.
43. [1/27/25, 9:00 AM] Suzane: attached:
Signed_Release_Forms.pdf
44. [1/27/25, 9:01 AM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Perfect, thank you. We
are dispatching the requests now via secure fax and courier.
45. [1/27/25, 2:00 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Update on your wife's
dermatology appointment: Dr. Ma's office has agreed to see
her. They have an opening due to a cancellation on Feb 15th.
We have tentatively booked it.
46. [1/27/25, 2:01 PM] Rohan: Excellent. Confirm it.
47. [1/28/25, 1:30 PM] Rohan: attached: Food_Log_Day2.png
48. [1/28/25, 1:31 PM] Ruby (Elyx Concierge): Got it. Thanks.
